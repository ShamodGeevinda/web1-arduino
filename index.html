<h2>What is Arduino?</h2>
<p>
  Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists 
  of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a
  piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, 
  used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.
  The Arduino platform has become quite popular with people just starting out with electronics, 
  and for good reason. Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need 
  a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) in order to load new code onto the board -- you 
  can simply use a USB cable. Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making 
  it easier to learn to program. Finally, Arduino provides a standard form factor that breaks out the
  functions of the micro-controller into a more accessible package
